Welcome to the Hadean era, spanning from 4.6 to 4 billion years ago, a time when Earth was a violent, fiery world. Imagine a newborn planet, its surface a swirling ocean of molten rock, with temperatures soaring beyond 1200 degrees Celsius. This was Earth, just after its formation through planetary accretion, where planetesimals collided and coalesced. Around 4.51 billion years ago, a colossal impact with a Mars-sized body named Theia led to the creation of our Moon. These relentless impacts prevented a solid crust from forming initially. However, beneath this chaos, differentiation occurred, with heavier elements like iron and nickel sinking to form the Earth's core, while lighter materials ascended to create the mantle. This era laid the groundwork for Earth's layered structure and its eventual habitability.
